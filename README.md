# faceDetection

This project built using Python programming language.There are a bunch of libraries are available in python language.one of them is OpenCV. OpenCV uses machine learning algorithms to search for faces within a picture. Because faces are so complicated, there isnâ€™t one simple test that will tell you if it found a face or not. Instead, there are thousands of small patterns and features that must be matched.
